        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          <img class="image-place" src="../img/about_me.png" alt="About Me" />
          I am a jewelry design expert, known for my creative designs and
          delicate drawings that encapsulate emotion. I deepened my
          understanding of various communication methods and design through my
          major in Mass Communication at Philippine Women's University. The core
          of my work lies in the details, and I strive to imbue each piece with
          my own stories and heart.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p><strong>Jewelry Personal Brand (6 years)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Over the span of 6 years, I honed my skills in jewelry design,
          focusing intensely on developing a unique design philosophy and style.
          From conceptualization to production, I took charge of the entire
          process, ensuring a seamless journey from idea to finished product. A
          key aspect of my role was maintaining clear and effective
          communication with customers, understanding their preferences and
          needs to deliver bespoke pieces that resonated with them personally.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fashion Jewelry Brand (2 years)</strong></p>
        <p>
          During my tenure at a fashion jewelry brand for 2 years, I had the
          opportunity to explore a wide range of materials and styles. This
          experience allowed me to innovate with designs that catered to
          accessible price points while staying abreast of current fashion
          trends. I thrived on the creative challenge of translating trends into
          wearable art, crafting pieces that were not only fashionable but also
          aligned with the brand's ethos of affordability and style.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Currently Employed at a Fine Jewelry Brand</strong></p>
        <p>
          I have recently transitioned back to the realm of fine jewelry, where
          I am currently employed. Here, my focus lies in the meticulous
          craftsmanship and luxurious design that define fine jewelry. My
          passion for this craft drives me to create pieces that go beyond mere
          adornment, aiming to capture and immortalize significant moments
          through intricate detailing and timeless elegance. This role allows me
          to delve deeply into the artistry of jewelry making, blending
          tradition with innovation to produce pieces of enduring beauty and
          significance. <br />
          <br />
          In summary, my career journey in the jewelry industry has been marked
          by continuous growth and evolution, from establishing a personal brand
          rooted in unique design to exploring the dynamic landscape of fashion
          jewelry and now returning to the artistry of fine jewelry, where I am
          committed to creating pieces that resonate on a profound level with
          discerning clients.

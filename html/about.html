            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a jewelry design expert, known for my creative designs and delicate drawings that
                encapsulate emotion.
                I deepened my understanding of various communication methods and design through my major in
                Mass Communication at Philippine Women's University. The core of my work lies in the
                details, and I strive to imbue each piece with my own stories and heart. </p>

                materials and
                styles.<br>
                I focused on developing products with accessible price points, pursuing designs that reflect
                current
                trends.</p>

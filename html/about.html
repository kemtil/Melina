                        <li>I am a jewelry design expert, known for my creative designs and delicate drawings that
                            encapsulate emotion.
                            I deepened my understanding of various communication methods and design through my major in
                            Mass Communication at Philippine Women's University. The core of my work lies in the
                            details, and I strive to imbue each piece with my own stories and heart.
